# Clustering-Techniques-on-Synthetic-Real-World-Data
The objective is to implement different clustering methods to synthetic and real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques

1. Used **K-means** and **hierarchical** clustering methods to generate clusters
2. Evaluated the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation
metrics like **Jaccard index**
3. Plotted the data points for each dataset and colored them according to the
original class
4. Plotted the data points for each dataset and colored them according to the
class allocated by the clustering algorithm
5. Used Internal validation metrics like **Silhouette** and **Dunn index** to report the cluster quality USING **WCSS** ( Within-Cluster Sum of Square )
